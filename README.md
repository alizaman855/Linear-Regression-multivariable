# Linear-Regression-multivariable
In this tutorial we will write python code to predict home prices using multivariate linear regression in python (using sklearn linear_model). Home prices are dependent on 3 independent variables: area, bedrooms and age. Pandas dataframe is used to fill missing values first and then use that dataset to train a multivariate regression model.
